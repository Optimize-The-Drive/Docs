# Optimize the Drive
###### Author: Nathan Dunn

### Overview
Users are able to create road trips by selecting locations on a map and/or searching for locations and having the application generate the best fit route. If users wish to save trips or make modifications to previous ones, they must sign up for account.

### Application Flow
* Users are greeted with a login screen. They can choose to sign up, login or continue without signing up.
* After signing up, logging in or continuing without signing up, the user lands on the main control page.
* In the main control page, the users are able to generate trips.
    * The trip generation begins by asking them where they would like to start.
    * They can pick and search the other locations for the trip on the map.
    * Once they are finished, they can click generate and the optimized trip is presented to them.
* If logged in, they can save these trips. Otherwise, they are prompted to sign up to enable this feature.
    * Trips can have notes assigned to them, either at the trip level or at the individual location level.
* If logged in, previous trips can be loaded and modified.
* Users can change their password.

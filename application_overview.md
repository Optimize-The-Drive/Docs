### Overview
Users are able to create road trips by selecting points on a map and/or searching for locations and having the application generate the best fit route. If users wish to save trips or make modifications to previous ones, they must sign up for account.

### Application Flow
* Users are greeted with a login screen. They can choose to sign up, login or continue without signing up.
* After signing up, logging in or continuing without signing up, the user lands on the main control page.
